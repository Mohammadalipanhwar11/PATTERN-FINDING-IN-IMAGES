# PATTERN FINDING IN IMAGES
 
Cross-correlation is a technique used to find patterns within images by comparing the similarity of two images or image regions. The process involves shifting one image with respect to the other and calculating the similarity at each shift. The result is a cross-correlation map, which is a 2-D matrix that shows the correlation values at each shift. The location in the map with the highest correlation value indicates the location of the pattern in the image.  

One of the main advantages of cross-correlation is that it is rotation and scale invariant, meaning that it can detect patterns regardless of their orientation or size. This makes it a useful technique for image alignment, object detection, and image registration.  

The cross-correlation process can be implemented using various algorithms, such as the Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) and the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Each algorithm has its own set of advantages and limitations, and the choice of algorithm depends on the specific application and the type of images being analyzed.  

In summary, cross-correlation is a powerful technique for finding patterns in images by comparing the similarity of two images or image regions. It is widely used in a variety of applications such as image alignment, object detection, and image registration.
